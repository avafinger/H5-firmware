Ubuntu Base Minimal Image (Xenial Xerus 16.04.3)
------------------------------------------------

Ubuntu Xenial Base Minimal Image (barebone minimal image) for the NanoPi NEO2 H5.

This OS Image firmware is based on legacy kernel 3.10.65+ squeezed to get some benefits like **CSI/VFE** already in use by Desktop Images.
This Image is made available so you can compare to and test the performance against Mainline kernel.

Please, note this is a WiP with a somewhat working DVFS cpu frequency ranging from 480 Mhz to 1008 Mhz.
Idle Temp. is ~ 35ÂºC without heatsink and the board works in a reliable way.

The goal here is to have USB camera working and the board run in a stable way.

**use at your own risk**
